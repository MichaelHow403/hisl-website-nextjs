# Example .env.local file

# AI API Keys (choose one or more for fallback support)
# The system will try them in this order: DeepSeek → Anthropic → OpenAI → Mock Response

# DeepSeek API Key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-key-here

# Anthropic API Key  
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here

# Note: You don't need all three keys. The system will use whichever ones are available.
# If no keys are provided, the system will use mock responses for development.
