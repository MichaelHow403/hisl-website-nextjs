# The Craftsman's Creed

Then prove we now with best endeavour;  
What from our efforts yet may spring;  
He justly is despised who never,  
Did thought to aide his labours bring;  

For this is arts true indication;  
When skill is minister to thought;  
When types that are the minds creation;  
The hand to perfect form has wrought.

*A reflection on the eternal partnership between vision and execution, where true mastery emerges when the mind's creation finds expression through skilled hands.*
